# Codewars C++ Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to a variety of [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) programming challenges, all written in C++. These exercises help me practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills.

## Structure

- Each file is named after the problem it solves, with a brief comment describing the challenge.
- Solutions are organized by problem difficulty or kata rank when possible.
- Katas Iâ€™m still working on are placed in the `in-progress/` folder. These may be incomplete or contain experimental code.

## How to Run

1. **Requirements:**  
   - C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
2. **Compile a Solution:**  
   ```
   g++ -std=c++17 file_name.cpp -o solution
   ```
3. **Run the Solution:**  
   ```
   ./solution
   ```


## Why C++?

I use C++ for these challenges to strengthen my understanding of its core features, including STL algorithms, memory management, and modern language constructs.
